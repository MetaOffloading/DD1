					+ "These special circles will initially appear in a different colour when they are first shown on the screen, instead of yellow. This is an instruction telling you where they should go.<br><br>"
					+ "For example, suppose that the circle with 7 in it was first shown in blue when it appeared on the screen. That would be an instruction that when you get to 7 in the sequence, you should drag that circle to the blue side of the box (left) instead of the bottom.<br><br>"

					+ "and drag them to the left, right, and bottom accordingly.<br><br>You do not need to follow the numberical sequence, so you can drag the circles to "
					+ "the edges of the box in whatever order you like. However, you can only drag a maximum of " + expectedTargets + " circles to the left and " + expectedTargets + " to the right.<br><br>"
